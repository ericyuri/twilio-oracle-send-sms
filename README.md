Twilio Oracle Send SMS

this code is almost the same what Aktham Nassar did and we can find here
https://github.com/aktham-nassar/twilio-sms-oracle.
Unfortunatly, his code doesn't work on my envrioment.
Instead of modifying his code, I prefred to create a new one on my side and use it as backup.

Fell free to copy and paste and test in your envrioment, but remember you must have a Oracle Wallet
and with you want to send more than your person at once you must have a payed account on Twilio
